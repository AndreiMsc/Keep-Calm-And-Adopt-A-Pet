The shelter administrator can update the database, meaning: add a new animal, delete a animal (when the animal 
is adopted) and update the information of a animal. Each Animal has a breed, a name, an age and a photograph. 
The photograph is memorised as a link towards an online resource (the photograph on the presentation
site of the centre). The administrators will also have the option to see all the animals in the shelter.
